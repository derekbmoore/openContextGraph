## Option 1: Problem-Solution Hook (Recommended)

**Most enterprise AI treats knowledge as flat. We're building a DIKW stack (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom) by integrating Microsoft Foundry IQ with ctxEco's governed memory.**

The result? AI that gives you **attributable answers with provenance**, **governed memory with decay management**, and **evidence-first responses**—not just answers, but answers enterprises can actually trust.

Read the full article to learn how we're combining Foundry IQ knowledge bases with context ecology to create enterprise AI that respects the knowledge hierarchy.

## Option 2: Direct Value Proposition

**Building enterprise AI that actually works: Foundry IQ + ctxEco integration creates a complete DIKW stack.**

✅ Attributable answers (provenance links)
✅ Governed memory (truth classes, sensitivity controls)  
✅ Cross-source synthesis (docs + telemetry)
✅ Evidence-first responses (auditable citations)

This is the difference between "AI that answers questions" and "AI that enterprises can deploy."

## Option 3: Question Hook

**What if enterprise AI didn't just answer questions—but told you where the answer came from, how reliable it is, and why you should trust it?**

That's what we're building by integrating Microsoft Foundry IQ with ctxEco's governed memory system. A DIKW approach (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom) that gives enterprises AI they can actually deploy.

Full article explains the architecture, integration patterns, and why this matters for enterprise adoption.

## Option 4: Technical Teaser

**Hybrid knowledge architecture: Foundry IQ handles enterprise docs (SharePoint, OneLake) while ctxEco provides governed memory with Tri-Search™, provenance tracking, and evidence bundles.**

Together, they create a complete DIKW stack where:
- Information has provenance (where did this come from?)
- Knowledge has decay rates (is this still true?)
- Answers have evidence (why should I trust this?)

## Option 5: Metrics-Focused

**< 60 minutes from tenant setup to first answer. > 80% evidence rate. Zero cross-tenant leakage.**

That's what we're achieving by integrating Microsoft Foundry IQ with ctxEco's governed memory system—a DIKW approach to enterprise AI that enterprises can actually trust.

Full article covers the architecture, integration patterns, and GTM vision.
