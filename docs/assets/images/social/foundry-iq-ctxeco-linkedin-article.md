**The Problem with Most Enterprise AI Solutions**

Most enterprise AI platforms treat knowledge as a single, flat layer. Documents go in, answers come out. But real enterprise knowledge isn't flat—it's a hierarchy: **Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom (DIKW)**.

That's why we're building a different approach: integrating **Microsoft Azure AI Foundry's Foundry IQ** knowledge bases with **ctxEco's governed memory system** to create a complete DIKW stack that enterprises can actually trust.

**What We're Building**

We're creating a hybrid knowledge architecture where:

🔹 **Foundry IQ** handles enterprise document grounding (SharePoint, OneLake, structured data) with built-in permission trimming

🔹 **ctxEco's KeywordVectorGraph** provides governed memory with:
- **Tri-Search™** (keyword + vector + graph fusion)
- **Provenance tracking** (every answer links back to source)
- **Decay management** (truth classes: immutable vs. ephemeral)
- **Evidence bundles** (auditable citations)

**The Integration Pattern**

Foundry agents use **both** knowledge planes:

1. **Foundry IQ KBs** for "my org's documents" (fast, permission-trimmed)
2. **ctxEco MCP tools** for:
   - Cross-source synthesis when KB coverage is incomplete
   - Episodic memory and operational telemetry
   - Specialized graph traversal ("why" explanations)
   - Ingestion governance and metadata enforcement

**Why This Matters**

Traditional RAG systems give you answers. Our DIKW approach gives you:

✅ **Attributable answers** (provenance links to source documents)
✅ **Governed memory** (decay rates, truth classes, sensitivity controls)
✅ **Cross-source synthesis** (unify SharePoint docs with operational telemetry)
✅ **Evidence-first responses** (auditable citations for compliance)

**The GTM Vision**

We're positioning ctxEco as a **"bring-your-own MCP server"** for Foundry, enabling enterprises to:

- Connect 10-16 high-signal sources (M365, GitHub, Splunk, databases)
- Get answers in < 60 minutes from tenant setup
- Maintain > 80% evidence rate (answers with citations)
- Enforce strict tenant/project/group boundaries

**What's Already Working**

✅ Foundry-first chat flow with HTTPS handling
✅ MCP server with working tools (search_memory, generate_story, generate_diagram)
✅ Tri-Search™ hybrid retrieval (keyword + vector + graph)
✅ Antigravity Router (A/B/C truth-class ingestion)

**What's Next**

We're building:
- KB-1 (M365 Knowledge): SharePoint + OneLake
- KB-2 (Engineering Knowledge): GitHub + architecture docs
- KB-3 (Operations Knowledge): Telemetry + incident runbooks

Plus a hardened MCP toolset: `search_memory`, `trigger_ingestion`, `get_evidence_bundle`, `list_sources`, `policy_check`.

**The Big Picture**

This isn't just about connecting data sources. It's about creating a **context ecology** where:
- Information has **provenance** (where did this come from?)
- Knowledge has **decay rates** (is this still true?)
- Answers have **evidence** (why should I trust this?)
- Actions have **governance** (who can do what, when?)

That's the difference between "AI that answers questions" and "AI that enterprises can actually deploy."

## Alternative Shorter Version (If LinkedIn Character Limit)

**Building Enterprise AI That Actually Works: Foundry IQ + ctxEco Integration**

Most enterprise AI treats knowledge as flat. We're building a DIKW stack (Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom) by integrating Microsoft Foundry IQ with ctxEco's governed memory.

**The Hybrid Approach:**
- Foundry IQ: Enterprise docs (SharePoint, OneLake) with permission trimming
- ctxEco: Governed memory with Tri-Search™, provenance, decay management, evidence bundles

**Why It Matters:**
✅ Attributable answers (provenance links)
✅ Governed memory (truth classes, sensitivity controls)
✅ Cross-source synthesis (docs + telemetry)
✅ Evidence-first responses (auditable citations)

**The Vision:**
Connect 10-16 sources, get answers in < 60 minutes, maintain > 80% evidence rate, enforce strict boundaries.

This is the difference between "AI that answers" and "AI that enterprises can deploy."
