# 🔐 Unified Login & The "Split Brain" Fix

We successfully overhauled the ctxEco authentication experience, unifying disparate login options into a premium glassmorphic modal and resolving a critical infrastructure configuration mismatch.

## 🛠️ The Challenge: "Split Brain" Configuration

During implementation, we encountered a persistent issue where the Google Login option was missing from the Azure Entra External ID (CIAM) popup, despite appearing correctly configured in the Azure Portal.

**Root Cause:**
We discovered a **Tenant Mismatch**:

- **Infrastructure**: Our Bicep templates were deploying our Container Apps using an App Registration (`94d5...`) located in the **Corporate Tenant** (ZimaxNet).
- **Identity**: Our User Flows were configured in a separate **CIAM tenant** (legacy).

CIAM User Flows cannot be linked to applications outside their own tenant. This created a "split brain" where our code pointed to the right User Flow but the wrong Application ID, causing the flow to ignore our Federation settings.

## ✅ The Solution

1. **Unified Authentication Modal**:
    - Replaced cluttered buttons with a sleek, centered modal.
    - Implemented `domain_hint: 'google.com'` to auto-direct users to the correct federated Identity Provider, skipping the confusing "Home Realm Discovery" screen.

2. **Configuration Synchronization**:
    - Created a new App Registration (`e32c...`) natively within the **CIAM Tenant**.
    - Updated **Infrastructure** (`parameters.json`), **GitHub Secrets**, and **Local Environment** (`.env`) to use this single source of truth.
    - Successfully deployed a "Config Only" hot-patch to Azure Container Apps.
