## 📝 Next Steps: Generate Story with Sage

The commit history is now in memory. To have Sage generate a story and visual:

### Option 1: Via Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Start the API server first
cd backend
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# In another terminal, run the story generation script
python3 scripts/generate_engram_story.py
```

### Option 2: Via MCP Tool (Direct)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "generate_story",
      "arguments": {
        "topic": "The Evolution of Engram: A Journey Through Commit History",
        "style": "informative",
        "length": "long"
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### Option 3: Via API Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/stories/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "The Evolution of Engram: A Journey Through Commit History",
    "style": "informative",
    "length": "long",
    "include_diagram": true,
    "include_image": true
  }'
```

### Option 4: Ask Sage Directly

Once the API is running, you can ask Sage:
> "Write a story about the evolution of Engram based on the commit history we just ingested. Include a visual diagram showing the architectural progression."

## 📊 What Was Ingested

The commit history document includes:
- **3,122 commits** from January 2024 to present
- **Major milestones:**
  - Antigravity Ingestion Router implementation
  - Avatar/WebRTC integration
  - Security enhancements (CODEOWNERS, pre-commit hooks)
  - NIST AI RMF alignment
  - Foundry IQ integration
  - Domain Memory implementation
  - And many more...

- **Architectural decisions** captured in commit messages
- **Bug fixes and solutions** documented
- **Project evolution** from concept to production

---

## 🎯 Expected Story Output

When Sage generates the story, it should:
1. **Synthesize** the commit history into a narrative
2. **Highlight** major architectural decisions
3. **Explain** the evolution from initial concept to production
4. **Create** a visual diagram showing the progression
5. **Generate** an architecture image

The story will be saved to:
- `docs/stories/story-{story_id}.md`
- `docs/assets/diagrams/story-{story_id}.json`
- `docs/assets/images/story-{story_id}.png`

---

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`docs/stories/engram-commit-history.md`**
   - Formatted commit history (markdown)
   - Ready for review or further processing

2. **`scripts/ingest_engram_commits_and_story.py`**
   - Script that performed the ingestion
   - Can be re-run to update commit history

3. **`scripts/generate_engram_story.py`**
   - Script to trigger story generation
   - Can be run once API server is started

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Commit history extracted from engram repo
- [x] Commit history formatted as markdown
- [x] Commit history ingested via Antigravity Router
- [x] Chunks stored in Zep memory (2,314 chunks)
- [ ] Story generated by Sage
- [ ] Visual diagram created
- [ ] Architecture image generated

---

## 🔄 To Re-run

If you need to update the commit history or regenerate:

```bash
# Re-ingest commit history
python3 scripts/ingest_engram_commits_and_story.py

# Generate story (after API is running)
python3 scripts/generate_engram_story.py
```
