## Story Generation Request

**For Agent:** Sage Meridian  
**Requested By:** Derek Moore  
**Date:** February 22, 2026

---

## Story Topic

The First Highly Trusted MCP + AI Agent Trust Verification System

---

## Directive

Generate this via Sage's **own workflow pipeline** (Story → Visual → Diagram JSON → Memory enrichment).  
Do not treat manually authored notes as final output artifacts.

---

## Seed Context for Sage

Use the existing narrative draft as background context and inspiration:

- [ctxEco/docs/stories/2026-02-22-sage-secairadar-trust-oracle.md](ctxEco/docs/stories/2026-02-22-sage-secairadar-trust-oracle.md)

Use secai-radar implementation/progress anchors:

- [secai-radar/README.md](secai-radar/README.md)
- [secai-radar/IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md](secai-radar/IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETE.md)
- [secai-radar/READY-FOR-DEPLOYMENT.md](secai-radar/READY-FOR-DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [secai-radar/apps/public-api/src/routers/well_known.py](secai-radar/apps/public-api/src/routers/well_known.py)

---

## Required Deliverables

1. **Story Markdown**
   - Long-form narrative explaining why this is agent-first and trust-authoritative.
   - Emphasize evidence-first scoring, temporal decay, and machine-readable discovery.

2. **Compelling Visual**
   - A polished social/hero image suitable for `/stories` visual tab.
   - Theme: futuristic trust oracle, verified MCP + AI agents, living trust graph.

3. **Diagram JSON (Nano Banana canonical schema)**
   - Technical architecture for visual thinkers.
   - Include major flow:
     - Scout/Curator → Evidence Miner → Scorer (D1..D6) → Decay Engine → Drift Sentinel → Publisher → Public API + Agent discovery endpoints.

---

## Story Requirements

### Tone

- Confident, technical, compelling.
- Agent-first framing before human-first framing.

### Structure

1. Why MCP/agent trust verification was necessary
2. How SecAI Radar established trust methodology
3. How decay and evidence confidence create honest trust over time
4. Why machine-readable trust contracts matter for autonomous agents
5. What this milestone unlocks next

---

## Output Expectations

- Artifacts must be generated and stored by Sage workflow in standard system locations.
- Workflow should enrich memory/session metadata for future retrieval.
- The resulting story should appear on `https://ctxeco.com/stories` through normal platform indexing.

---

## Notes

This request supersedes any assumption that story artifacts are manually produced in-chat.  
Sage is the authority for generating the canonical story/visual/diagram bundle.
