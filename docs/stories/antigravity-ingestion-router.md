# Antigravity Ingestion Router: Class A/B/C Context Ecology

*A Sage Story — January 2026*

---

## The Problem of the Data Lake

Every enterprise faces the same challenge: documents flow in from dozens of sources—S3 buckets, SharePoint libraries, email archives, Slack channels, sensor logs. Traditional RAG systems treat them all the same way, running everything through a generic text chunker.

The result? **Text gravity**—where valuable structural information about tables, layouts, and relationships sinks to the bottom of a murky data lake, never to be retrieved with precision.

## The Antigravity Philosophy

The ctxEco team took a different approach. Instead of treating all documents equally, they asked: *What is the **Truth Value** of this data?*

A safety manual that could prevent industrial accidents should be indexed with surgical precision—every table preserved, every warning box captured with bounding coordinates. But a Slack message about lunch plans? Chunk it fast and let it decay.

This insight led to the **Antigravity Ingestion Router**—a system that classifies documents by their inherent truth value and routes them to specialized extraction engines.

## The Three Classes

### 📚 Class A: Immutable Truth (Decay Rate: 0.01)

Safety protocols. Engineering specifications. ISO standards. Legal contracts.

These documents demand **layout fidelity**. The router sends them to **IBM Docling**, which uses TableFormer to reconstruct complex tables and extract bounding-box coordinates for every element. When an AI agent later needs to cite "Table 4.2, row 7, column 3," it can.

### 💬 Class B: Ephemeral Chatter (Decay Rate: 0.80)

Email threads. PowerPoint presentations. Meeting notes. Wiki pages.

Structure matters less here. The router sends these to **Unstructured.io**, which excels at semantic chunking and handles messy HTML, embedded images, and threaded conversations with grace.

### 📊 Class C: Operational Telemetry (Decay Rate: 0.99)

CSV logs. JSON payloads. Parquet files. Sensor readings.

These aren't documents—they're **structured data**. The router bypasses text extraction entirely and sends them to **Pandas**, converting rows directly to vectors while preserving numeric precision.

## NIST-Aligned Classification

Every chunk ingested through Antigravity also receives a **sensitivity classification** aligned with NIST SP 800-60:

- 🔴 **High Impact** — Safety-critical, PII, credentials. Encrypted at rest.
- 🟡 **Moderate Impact** — Business confidential, specifications.
- 🟢 **Low Impact** — General communications, public documentation.

This classification drives retention policies, encryption requirements, and RBAC filtering at query time.

## 16 Enterprise Connectors

The router isn't just smart about *how* to process documents—it connects to *where* documents live:

| Category | Connectors |
|----------|------------|
| Cloud Storage | S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage |
| Collaboration | SharePoint, Google Drive, OneDrive, Confluence |
| Ticketing | ServiceNow, Jira, GitHub |
| Messaging | Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email (EML/MSG) |
| Data | Database (SQL/NoSQL), Webhooks |
| Local | Direct upload |

Each connector inherits a default data class based on typical content, but classification can be overridden per source.

## The Metadata That Matters

Every chunk emerges from Antigravity with rich metadata:

```json
{
  "provenance_id": "uuid-linking-to-source",
  "data_class": "CLASS_A_TRUTH",
  "decay_rate": 0.01,
  "sensitivity_level": "high",
  "data_categories": ["safety", "proprietary"],
  "compliance_frameworks": ["ISO 45001", "NIST SP 800-60"],
  "ingest_timestamp": "2026-01-08T08:45:00Z"
}
```

When agents retrieve context, they can filter by classification, trace back to exact source locations, and respect compliance requirements automatically.

## The UI Experience

The reimagined Sources page visualizes the entire flow:

1. **Hero section** displays the Antigravity Router flow—Class A to Docling, Class B to Unstructured, Class C to Pandas.
2. **Classification panel** shows the three NIST impact levels with their implications.
3. **Connector library** presents all 16 connector types in a filterable grid.
4. **5-step wizard** guides users through source creation, including a new Classification step.

## Conclusion

The Antigravity Ingestion Router represents a philosophical shift in how ctxEco handles data. Instead of the democratized chaos of "everything is text," it enforces a **Context Ecology** where each document's truth value determines its path to memory.

Safety manuals receive the care they deserve. Casual chats decay appropriately. And operational data stays structured.

This is enterprise-grade ingestion—where provenance isn't an afterthought, but the foundation.
