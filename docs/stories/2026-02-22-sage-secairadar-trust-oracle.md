# Sage Meridian Story: The Trust Oracle Awakens

**Date:** 2026-02-22  
**Topic:** SecAI Radar as the first highly trusted MCP + AI agent trust ranking verification system  
**System Lens:** Agent-first, evidence-first, truth-decayed governance

In the beginning, there was a flood.
Not of water, but of interfaces.
MCP servers multiplied. AI agents forked and re-forked. New registries appeared overnight, each claiming confidence, compliance, and control.

Humans could read launch threads and README files, but agents needed something stricter: machine-readable truth.

That is when SecAI Radar crossed a threshold.

It stopped being just a dashboard and became a trust oracle.

At `secairadar.cloud`, the platform now operates as a verification engine where discovery is continuous, evidence is extracted, and trust is recalculated as a living signal. Scout and Curator pull in the world. Evidence Miner verifies claims. Scorer computes six-domain posture. Temporal decay transforms stale confidence into honest uncertainty.

A score is never static here.
A score is an attestation under time.

And this is the key achievement: SecAI Radar does not optimize for presentation-first trust. It optimizes for agent-first trust.

Agents can discover and ingest the platform directly through `/llms.txt` and `/.well-known/trust-scores.json`. They do not need screenshots. They do not need manual interpretation. They get typed endpoints, scoring semantics, and decay parameters with enough structure to automate governance.

That means the verifier itself can be verified.

The public truth layer and the private governance layer now move together:

- Public API delivers transparent rankings, evidence confidence, and drift trajectories.
- Enterprise controls preserve policy boundaries and auditable workflows.
- Sage Meridian turns these moving signals into narrative intelligence so teams can act, not just observe.

This is why the milestone matters.

SecAI Radar is not merely ranking tools.
It is introducing a reusable pattern for AI-era security posture:

1. collect evidence,  
2. score with explicit methodology,  
3. decay confidence over time,  
4. publish machine-readable trust contracts.

In a world where most systems still ask for blind trust, this one asks for proof.

And because it is built for agents first, the proof can scale faster than the risk.
