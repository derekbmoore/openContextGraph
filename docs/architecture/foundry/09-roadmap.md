# Foundry Features Roadmap (GTM MVP)

This roadmap keeps the wiki aligned to what we need to **ship and sell**.

## Phase 1 (GTM MVP): Knowledge + Tools

- **Foundry IQ KBs** (M365 Knowledge): SharePoint + OneLake where possible  
  - paired with ctxEco memory + evidence bundles
- **ctxEco MCP server** as the primary Tools surface
- **Golden thread**: repeatable demo proving DIKW end-to-end

Docs:
- [Foundry IQ + ctxEco Integration Master](../08-foundry-iq-ctxeco-integration-master.md)
- [Knowledge](../../knowledge/)
- [Tools](../../tools/)

## Phase 2: Multi-agent orchestration

- Elena → Marcus → Sage workflows
- shared context + observability

Docs:
- [Multi-Agent Orchestration (Foundry)](04-multi-agent-orchestration.md)

## Phase 3: M365 “meet users where they work”

- publish Elena to Teams
- expand SharePoint grounding
- add OneDrive ingestion path when needed (via ingestion to Blob/OneLake or via controlled tool)
