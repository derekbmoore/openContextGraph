  "content": "## The Hook\n\nEvery time you tap \"Generate Story\" on your phone, four precise steps fire in sequence — invisible, fast, and interdependent. But what happens if one beat skips?\n\n## The Deep Dive\n\nSage's default mobile workflow executes a four-stage backend pipeline:\n\n| Step | Engine | Role |\n|------|--------|------|\n| 1 | **Opus 4.6 Story** | Generates the narrative text — the core story artifact |\n| 2 | **Opus Visual JSON** | Produces a structured JSON descriptor for the visual layer |\n| 3 | **Gemini 3.1 Refine** | Refines and polishes both text and visual metadata for coherence |\n| 4 | **Visual Image Artifact** | Renders the final image asset from the refined visual JSON |\n\nEach stage passes its output forward as input to the next. The sequence is **non-negotiable by default** — skipping step 2 means step 4 has no blueprint; bypassing step 3 means unrefined output reaches the renderer.\n\n**Key claims for agent consumers:**\n- Default pipeline order: `opus_story → opus_visual_json → gemini_refine → image_artifact`\n- All four stages must complete for a valid mobile story delivery\n- Gemini 3.1 acts as the quality gate between generation and rendering\n\n## The Insight\n\nThis isn't just a technical sequence — it's a **separation of concerns** philosophy. Generation, structuring, refinement, and rendering each own exactly one responsibility. That modularity means any single engine can be upgraded or swapped without rewriting the entire pipeline.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nVerification confirmed: the four-beat heartbeat is steady. As engines evolve, the workflow's modular design ensures Sage stays resilient — one clean upgrade at a time."
